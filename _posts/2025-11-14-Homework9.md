# 1. Main interpretations of probability

This section lists common interpretations and states their conceptual focus and limitations.

## 1.1 Classical (Laplace)
Definition: Probability of an event = number of favorable equally possible outcomes divided by number of all equally possible outcomes.

Focus: symmetry and combinatorics; natural for games of chance.

Limitation: requires an objective notion of equally likely outcomes; fails or is ambiguous when symmetry isn’t present.

## 1.2 Frequentist (von Mises)
Definition: Probability of event $A$ is the limiting relative frequency of $A$ in an infinite sequence of repeatable trials:
$$ P(A)=\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{N_n(A)}{n}. $$

Focus: long-run behavior of repeatable experiments.

Limitation: depends on the notion of an idealized infinite sequence; doesn’t assign probabilities to one-off events naturally.

## 1.3 Bayesian (subjective / epistemic)
Definition: Probability is a degree of belief, represented numerically and updated by Bayes’ rule when evidence arrives.

Focus: individual/agent uncertainty and learning; assigns probabilities to hypotheses and single events.

Limitation: requires prior probabilities; subjectivity/choice-of-prior debates.

## 1.4 Geometric (ratio-of-length/area/volume)
Definition: Probability defined by ratios of geometric measures (length, area, volume) of favorable region to total region in a continuous sample space.

Focus: continuous analogue of the classical approach.

Limitation: depends on choice of coordinate system or parametrization unless symmetry justifies the measure.

## 1.5 Propensity / Physical (Popper)
Definition: Probability is a dispositional property of a physical setup (tendency or propensity to produce an outcome under specified conditions).

Focus: single-case physical experiments, causal interpretation.

Limitation: metaphysical; hard to make operationally precise without appeal to frequencies or measures.

## 1.6 Logical / Objective Bayesian (Jeffreys, Keynes)
Definition: Probability is an objective logical relation between evidence and hypothesis; degrees of plausibility constrained by symmetry and invariance principles.

Focus: formal rules for rational belief inferences.

Limitation: choice of logical rules can be controversial; ties back to choice of priors.

# 2. How the axiomatic approach resolves conceptual inconsistencies

The Kolmogorov axioms (1933) decouple interpretation from calculus: they provide a minimal, consistent algebraic/measure-theoretic structure that any interpretation must satisfy. The axioms are:

1. Non-negativity: for any event $A$, $P(A)\ge 0$.
2. Normalization: $P(\Omega)=1$ where $\Omega$ is the sample space.
3. Countable additivity: for any countable sequence of pairwise disjoint events $A_1,A_2,\dots$,
   $$ P\Big(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i\Big)=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A_i). $$

Resolution mechanism:

- **Unification:** All interpretations become *models* that must map their primitive concepts (equipossible outcomes, limiting frequencies, degrees of belief, geometric measure, propensity) into the Kolmogorov structure $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$. If the interpretation can be represented by a probability measure on a sigma-algebra, it inherits the standard calculus.

- **Separation of concerns:** Interpretations supply semantics (how to choose $\Omega,\mathcal{F},P$), while axioms supply syntax (rules for manipulating probabilities). Disagreements about semantics (priors, physical propensities, symmetry choices) do not imply contradictions in probability algebra.

- **Objectivity of results:** Theorems derived from axioms (Law of Large Numbers, Central Limit Theorem, conditional probability rules) hold regardless of interpretation provided the model satisfies the axioms. This prevents conceptual paradoxes that arise when different informal intuitions are applied inconsistently.

- **Measure-theoretic rigor:** The countable additivity axiom rules out certain pathological assignments (e.g., finitely additive but non-countably-additive measures) that can produce counterintuitive results in infinite settings; measure theory provides the technical framework to avoid such contradictions.

# 3. Relationship between probability theory and measure theory

Probability theory is measure theory specialized: a probability space is a measure space with total measure 1. Key correspondences follow.

## 3.1 Sigma-algebras ($\sigma$-algebras)
- A $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}$ on a set $\Omega$ is a collection of subsets of $\Omega$ closed under complement and countable unions. Events are elements of $\mathcal{F}$.
- Rationale: closure properties match the need to form complements, unions, countable operations (limits) and thereby to make probability compatible with limits and infinite operations.

## 3.2 Probability measure
- A probability measure is a function $P:\mathcal{F}\to[0,1]$ satisfying the Kolmogorov axioms (measure-theoretic axioms + total mass 1).
- All standard measure-theoretic results apply (monotonicity, continuity from above/below, dominated convergence for integrals of random variables, etc.).

## 3.3 Measurable functions and random variables
- A function $X:(\Omega,\mathcal{F})\to(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$ is **measurable** if for every Borel set $B\subseteq\mathbb{R}$, the preimage $X^{-1}(B)\in\mathcal{F}$.
- Such a measurable function is a **random variable**. Measurability ensures we can assign probabilities to events like $\{\omega: X(\omega)\in B\}$.

## 3.4 Integration, expectation, distribution
- Expectation is the Lebesgue integral of a random variable: $\mathbb{E}[X]=\int_{\Omega} X(\omega)\,dP(\omega)$ (when integrable).
- The distribution (law) of $X$ is the pushforward measure $P_X(B)=P(X\in B)=P(X^{-1}(B))$ on $(\mathbb{R},\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$.

## 3.5 Why measure theory matters
- Measure theory handles continuous spaces, uncountable operations, limits, and interchange of limit/integral operations rigorously. Many probabilistic limit theorems require Lebesgue integration and dominated convergence or monotone convergence.

# 4. Derivations from the axioms

Let $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$ be a probability space.

## 4.1 Basic consequences of the axioms (used below)

1. Monotonicity: if $A\subseteq B$, then $P(A)\le P(B)$. Proof: $B=A\cup(B\setminus A)$ is disjoint union, apply finite additivity.

2. Complement rule: $P(A^c)=1-P(A)$.

3. Finite additivity: if $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, then $P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)$. This is the special case of countable additivity.

4. Continuity from above / below (standard measure results):
   - If $A_n\uparrow A$ (i.e., $A_1\subseteq A_2\subseteq\dots$ and $A=\bigcup_n A_n$), then $P(A)=\lim_{n\to\infty} P(A_n)$.
   - If $A_n\downarrow A$ and $P(A_1)<\infty$, then $P(A)=\lim_{n\to\infty} P(A_n)$.

## 4.2 Subadditivity (union bound)
**Claim.** For any countable collection $A_1,A_2,\dots\in\mathcal{F}$,
$$ P\Big(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i\Big) \le \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A_i). $$

**Proof.** Construct disjoint sets by removing previous parts:
$$ B_1:=A_1,\qquad B_2:=A_2\setminus A_1,\qquad B_3:=A_3\setminus (A_1\cup A_2),\ \dots $$
Each $B_i$ is measurable and the $B_i$ are pairwise disjoint. Also $\bigcup_i A_i = \bigcup_i B_i$. By countable additivity,
$$ P\Big(\bigcup_{i} A_i\Big)=\sum_{i} P(B_i). $$
Since $B_i\subseteq A_i$ for each $i$, monotonicity gives $P(B_i)\le P(A_i)$. Summing yields the desired inequality.

**Corollary (Boole’s inequality / union bound):** holds for any finite or countable family.

## 4.3 Inclusion–exclusion principle

### Finite version
**Claim.** For two events $A,B$,
$$ P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B). $$

**Proof.** Partition $A\cup B$ into three disjoint pieces: $A\setminus B,\ B\setminus A,\ A\cap B$. Then by finite additivity,
$$ P(A\cup B)=P(A\setminus B)+P(B\setminus A)+P(A\cap B). $$
But $P(A)=P(A\setminus B)+P(A\cap B)$ and similarly for $P(B)$. Adding and rearranging yields the formula.

**General finite inclusion–exclusion (n events).** For events $A_1,\dots,A_n$:
$$ P\Big(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\Big)=\sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k+1} \sum_{1\le i_1<\cdots<i_k\le n} P(A_{i_1}\cap\cdots\cap A_{i_k}). $$

**Proof (by induction / combinatorial partitioning).** Outline:
- For $n=1$ trivial; for $n=2$ shown above.
- Assume formula for $n-1$ events. Write
  $$ P\Big(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\Big)=P\Big(\Big(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1} A_i\Big)\cup A_n\Big). $$
  Apply the two-set formula with $A=\bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1} A_i$ and $B=A_n$. Expand $P(A\cap A_n)=P\big(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n-1}(A_i\cap A_n)\big)$ using the induction hypothesis on the $n-1$ events $A_i\cap A_n$. Combining terms yields the alternating-sum expression.

### Infinite families — generalization and caution
- Inclusion–exclusion for infinite countable families requires conditions to ensure absolute convergence of the sums of intersections; otherwise the alternating series may not converge and equality can fail. In practice the finite form and the union bound are the most broadly applicable.

# 5. Examples and remarks

- Classical and geometric interpretations become measure-theoretic constructions by taking $\Omega$ finite or a region in $\mathbb{R}^d$ endowed with a normalized counting or Lebesgue measure respectively.
- Frequentist interpretation connects to measure theory via empirical measures: for i.i.d. trials the empirical distribution converges (weakly) to the probability measure; Law of Large Numbers is a rigorous bridge.
- Bayesian interpretation fits inside the axioms: a subjective prior is simply a probability measure on $\Omega$ encoding the agent’s beliefs; Bayes’ theorem follows from axioms via conditional probability.

# 6. Summary (concise)

- Multiple philosophical interpretations exist; each supplies semantics for choosing $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$.
- Kolmogorov’s axioms and measure theory provide a single, rigorous calculus that resolves contradictions by separating semantics from the algebraic/analytic rules.
- Probability spaces are measure spaces with total mass 1; random variables are measurable functions and expectation is an integral.
- From the axioms follow the union bound (subadditivity) and the inclusion–exclusion formulas; these are proven by elementary measure/axiomatic arguments.
