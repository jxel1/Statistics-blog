# 1. Main interpretations of probability

This section lists common interpretations and states their conceptual focus and limitations.

## 1.1 Classical (Laplace)
Definition: Probability of an event = number of favorable equally possible outcomes divided by number of all equally possible outcomes.

Focus: symmetry and combinatorics; natural for games of chance.

Limitation: requires an objective notion of equally likely outcomes; fails or is ambiguous when symmetry isn’t present.

## 1.2 Frequentist (von Mises)
Definition: Probability of event \( A \) is the limiting relative frequency of \( A \) in an infinite sequence of repeatable trials:
$$ P(A) = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{N_n(A)}{n}. $$

Focus: long-run behavior of repeatable experiments.

Limitation: depends on the notion of an idealized infinite sequence; doesn’t assign probabilities to one-off events naturally.

## 1.3 Bayesian (subjective / epistemic)
Definition: Probability is a degree of belief, represented numerically and updated by Bayes’ rule when evidence arrives.

Focus: individual/agent uncertainty and learning; assigns probabilities to hypotheses and single events.

Limitation: requires prior probabilities; subjectivity/choice-of-prior debates.

## 1.4 Geometric (ratio-of-length/area/volume)
Definition: Probability defined by ratios of geometric measures (length, area, volume) of favorable region to total region in a continuous sample space.

Focus: continuous analogue of the classical approach.

Limitation: depends on choice of coordinate system or parametrization unless symmetry justifies the measure.

## 1.5 Propensity / Physical (Popper)
Definition: Probability is a dispositional property of a physical setup (tendency or propensity to produce an outcome under specified conditions).

Focus: single-case physical experiments, causal interpretation.

Limitation: metaphysical; hard to make operationally precise without appeal to frequencies or measures.

## 1.6 Logical / Objective Bayesian (Jeffreys, Keynes)
Definition: Probability is an objective logical relation between evidence and hypothesis; degrees of plausibility constrained by symmetry and invariance principles.

Focus: formal rules for rational belief inferences.

Limitation: choice of logical rules can be controversial; ties back to choice of priors.

# 2. How the axiomatic approach resolves conceptual inconsistencies

The Kolmogorov axioms (1933) decouple interpretation from calculus: they provide a minimal, consistent algebraic/measure-theoretic structure that any interpretation must satisfy. The axioms are:

1. Non-negativity: for any event \( A \), \( P(A) \ge 0 \).
2. Normalization: \( P(\Omega) = 1 \) where \( \Omega \) is the sample space.
3. Countable additivity: for any countable sequence of pairwise disjoint events \( A_1, A_2, \dots \),
   $$ P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A_i). $$

Resolution mechanism:

- **Unification:** All interpretations become *models* that must map their primitive concepts into the Kolmogorov structure \( (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P) \).
- **Separation of concerns:** Interpretations supply semantics; axioms supply syntax.
- **Objectivity of results:** Theorems hold regardless of interpretation.
- **Measure-theoretic rigor:** Countable additivity avoids pathologies.

# 3. Relationship between probability theory and measure theory

Probability theory is measure theory specialized: a probability space is a measure space with total measure 1.

## 3.1 Sigma-algebras (\( \sigma \)-algebras)
- A \( \sigma \)-algebra \( \mathcal{F} \) on \( \Omega \) is closed under complement and countable unions.
- Events are elements of \( \mathcal{F} \).

## 3.2 Probability measure
- \( P: \mathcal{F} \to [0,1] \) satisfying Kolmogorov axioms.

## 3.3 Measurable functions and random variables
- \( X: (\Omega, \mathcal{F}) \to (\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})) \) is **measurable** if \( X^{-1}(B) \in \mathcal{F} \) for all Borel \( B \).
- Such \( X \) is a **random variable**.

## 3.4 Integration, expectation, distribution
- Expectation: \( \mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{\Omega} X(\omega)\, dP(\omega) \).
- Distribution: \( P_X(B) = P(X \in B) \).

## 3.5 Why measure theory matters
- Handles continuous spaces, limits, dominated convergence, etc.

# 4. Derivations from the axioms

Let \( (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P) \) be a probability space.

## 4.1 Basic consequences

1. **Monotonicity:** \( A \subseteq B \Rightarrow P(A) \le P(B) \).
2. **Complement:** \( P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) \).
3. **Finite additivity:** disjoint \( A, B \Rightarrow P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) \).
4. **Continuity from above/below.**

## 4.2 Subadditivity (union bound)
**Claim.** For any countable \( A_1, A_2, \dots \),
$$ P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i\right) \le \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(A_i). $$

**Proof.** Let \( B_1 = A_1 \), \( B_2 = A_2 \setminus A_1 \), etc. Then \( B_i \) disjoint, \( \bigcup A_i = \bigcup B_i \), and \( P(B_i) \le P(A_i) \). Apply additivity and monotonicity.

**Corollary:** Boole’s inequality.

## 4.3 Inclusion–exclusion principle

### Finite version (2 events)
$$ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B). $$

**Proof:** Disjoint partition: \( A \cup B = (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A) \cup (A \cap B) \).

### General finite
$$ P\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\right) = \sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k+1} \sum_{1 \le i_1 < \cdots < i_k \le n} P(A_{i_1} \cap \cdots \cap A_{i_k}). $$

**Proof by induction.**

### Infinite families
Requires absolute convergence; otherwise may fail.

# 5. Examples and remarks

- Classical → counting measure.
- Frequentist → LLN links empirical to theoretical measure.
- Bayesian → prior is a probability measure; Bayes’ theorem from axioms.

# 6. Summary

- Multiple interpretations → semantics.
- Kolmogorov + measure theory → unified calculus.
- Probability = normalized measure; expectation = integral.
- Union bound and inclusion–exclusion derived from axioms.
