## Measures of Location and Dispersion

Statistical analysis often begins with two core ideas: **location** (where the data tend to cluster) and **dispersion** (how widely the data are spread).  
Measures of location describe central tendency — a single representative value that characterizes the distribution.  
Measures of dispersion describe how much the values vary from that center.  
Together, they summarize the overall shape and stability of a dataset.

### Measures of Location (Averages)

Different means and central measures serve distinct purposes depending on data type, symmetry, and sensitivity to outliers.

| **Mean Type** | **Formula** | **Typical Use** | **Notes** |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Arithmetic Mean** | \\( \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum x_i \\) | Symmetric numeric data without outliers | Most common; sensitive to extremes |
| **Median** | Middle value in ordered data | Skewed distributions or data with outliers | Robust; ignores magnitude differences |
| **Mode** | Most frequent value | Categorical or discrete data | Can be multiple or undefined |
| **Geometric Mean** | \\( (\prod x_i)^{1/n} \\) | Growth rates, ratios, percentages | All values must be positive |
| **Harmonic Mean** | \\( n / \sum(1/x_i) \\) | Averages of rates (speed, density) | Dominated by small values |
| **Weighted Mean** | \\( \sum w_i x_i / \sum w_i \\) | Unequal importance or frequency | Weights reflect relevance |
| **Trimmed Mean** | Arithmetic mean after removing top/bottom *k%* | Mild outliers | Balance between mean and median |
| **Midrange** | \\( (x_{\text{max}} + x_{\text{min}})/2 \\) | Rough estimate for symmetric data | Extremely sensitive to outliers |
| **Quadratic Mean (RMS)** | \\( \sqrt{(\sum x_i^2)/n} \\) | Magnitudes (voltages, velocities) | Always ≥ arithmetic mean |

Each of these measures captures “location” differently.  
The arithmetic mean dominates general use, but the median and trimmed mean are favored when outliers distort averages.  
The geometric and harmonic means specialize in multiplicative or rate-based contexts, respectively.

### Measures of Dispersion

While averages locate the center, dispersion measures describe variability — how far the data points lie from that center.  
High dispersion implies inconsistency; low dispersion means values are tightly clustered.

| Measure | Formula | Use | Notes |
|--------:|:--------|:----|:------|
| **Variance** | \\( s^2 = \dfrac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \\) | Quantifies spread around the mean | Sensitive to outliers |
| **Standard Deviation** | \\( s = \sqrt{s^2} \\) | Same units as the data | Directly comparable to the mean |
| **Range** | \\( x\_{\text{max}} - x\_{\text{min}} \\) | Quick spread estimate | Affected by extremes |
| **Interquartile Range (IQR)** | \\( \text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1 \\) | Resistant to outliers | Describes the middle 50% |
| **Coefficient of Variation (CV)** | \\( \mathrm{CV} = \dfrac{s}{\bar{x}} \\) | Relative variability (unit-free) | Useful for comparing variability across scales |

Dispersion complements central tendency.  
Variance and standard deviation are the standard analytical tools, while IQR and CV are used when data are skewed or measured on different scales.  
Together, these statistics summarize both the *center* and the *spread* of any dataset, forming the foundation for further statistical inference.
